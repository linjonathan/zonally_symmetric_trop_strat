# Zonally Symmetric Troposphere-Stratosphere

Solves for the coupled troposphere-stratosphere response to a SST perturbation, under QE dynamics. Modify the input parameters as you see fit, which will change the non-dimensional controlling parameters of the model. You will also need to set the meridional SST function, in sT.
